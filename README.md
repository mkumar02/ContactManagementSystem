ContactManagementSystem developed as a programming exercise for MNP.
This repository is a POC to lay out basic architecture for Contact Management System.
.Net Core Web API used to develop APIs, class library has models, .Net Core Web MVC used for front end consuming the APIs. xUnit Framework is used for writing unit tests.
I used MS SQL server to store data. Any relational database can be used.
Further developments can include adding more unit tests in xUnit, enhancing UI, adding more validations, logging errors, exhaustive exception handling.
